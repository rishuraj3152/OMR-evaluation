# OMR-evaluation
Evaluating OMR using cv2

The code and complete explanation has already been given here:
https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/10/03/bubble-sheet-multiple-choice-scanner-and-test-grader-using-omr-python-and-opencv/

All of my code credit goes to Adrian Rosebrock. Some additional features has been added which are as follows:
1) Multiple options correct
2) no matter how page has been scanned, even titled one will have its evaluation correct.
3) Certain additional questions and answers can be added efficiently

test_scc.py file has code for evaluating single correct omr evaluation
test_mcc.py file has code for evaluationg multiple correct omr evaluation
source images zipped folder contains the test sample images upon which the code works perfectly
